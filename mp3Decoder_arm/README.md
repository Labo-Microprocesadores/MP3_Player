## What it is

this is the mp3 file decoder implementation made for arm microprocessors, in particular for FRDM-K64F. This project is made for the "Microprocessor lab" chair ITBA 2020.

The idea behind this project is to create a Mp3 Decoder that can create a buffer with the decoding the mp3 information.

When it does that it find also the ID3 Tags of the song and some information about the file like the size and the number of frames decoded to show in the LCD 16x2 that the project has.
